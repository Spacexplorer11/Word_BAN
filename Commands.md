## Commands

These are the commands you can use with Word BAN:

- `/ban-word [word]` – Bans a word in the channel it's run.  
- `/unban-word [word]` – Unbans a word in the channel it's run.  
- `/banned-words` – Lists banned words in the channel it's run.  
- `/is-banned [word]` – Checks if a word is banned in the channel it's run.  
- `/score` – View your score.  
- `/naughty-leaderboard` – See who’s using the most banned words. 
- `/reflect` - Write a reflection and get the channel to upvote/downvote it! Your own votes and the bot's votes don't count.
- - If you get more upvotes than downvotes, your score resets to 0!
- - On the other hand, if you get more downvotes than upvotes or its a tie, your score stays the same.
