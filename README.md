# Welcome to Word BAN
![Hackatime badge](https://hackatime-badge.hackclub.com/U08D22QNUVD/word_ban)

Word BAN is a quirky Slack bot for playful word-banning in specific channels.  
Ever wanted to ban the word *"dog"* in your *#cat-appreciation* channel? Now you can.  
⚠️ This is **not** a moderation bot. It’s just a light-hearted bot for word-related fun — not a substitute for a proper profanity filter.

## What can it do?

Whenever someone uses a banned word, the bot replies with a warning message.  
You get to customise that message: serious or sassy.*  
(There is a default message if you don’t set one, so don't worry!)

But that’s not all. It does a whole lot more:

- Every banned word spoken drops a user’s score.  
- There’s a leaderboard  
- Set punishments when someone hits a low enough score — reactions, cheeky replies, etc*  
- Users can check their score or the leaderboard at any time.  
- Users can *downvote* others' banned-word messages to bump their own score up.*  
- Users can write a “banned word reflection” explaining themselves, post it to the channel, and if the community votes in favour, their score is reset*  
- Banned words are case-insensitive by default — so *"Dog"*, *"dog"*, and *"DoG"* are all treated the same.  
- Banned word checks ignore punctuation and spacing quirks, so users can't bypass bans with tricks like "d.o.g".
