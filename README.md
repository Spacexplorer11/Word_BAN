# 🧙‍♂️ Welcome to Word BAN

Word BAN is your quirky Slack bot sidekick for playful word-banning mayhem in specific channels.  
Ever wanted to ban the word *"dog"* in your *#cat-appreciation* channel? Now you can.  
⚠️ This is **not** a moderation bot. It’s just a light-hearted companion for word-related fun — not a substitute for a proper profanity filter.

## 🛠️ What can it do?

Whenever someone uses a banned word, the bot swoops in with a warning message.  
You get to customise that message — whether it’s serious or full-on sass.*
(There is a default message if you don’t set one, so no worries!)

But that’s not all. Here’s where things get spicy:

- 🔻 Every banned word spoken drops a user’s score.*  
- 🏆 There’s a leaderboard to keep things competitive.*  
- ⛓️ Set punishments when someone hits a low enough score — reactions, cheeky replies, you name it.*  
- 🔍 Users can check their score or the leaderboard at any time.*  
- 👎 Users can *downvote* others' banned-word messages to bump their own score up.*  
- 📝 Users can write a “banned word reflection” explaining themselves — post it to the channel, and if the community votes in favour, they get a clean slate.*  
  Banned words are case-insensitive by default — so *"Dog"*, *"dog"*, and *"DoG"* are all treated the same.  
  Banned word checks ignore punctuation and spacing quirks, so users can't bypass bans with tricks like "d.o.g".*


## 🔧 Commands

These are the commands you can use with Word BAN:

- `/ban-word [word]` – Bans a word in the channel it's run.  
- `/unban-word [word]` – Unbans a word in the channel it's run.  
- `/banned-words` – Lists banned words in the channel it's run*  
- `/score` – View your score.*  
- `/leaderboard` – See who’s dodging the most banned words (or not).*  
- `/reflect [your message]` – Submit a reflection after using a banned word.*  

🔐 Only the **channel creator** or a **workspace admin/owner** can use `/ban-word` and `/unban-word` (due to Slack API limitations — "channel manager" status isn't visible to bots).  
✨ Soon: Channel creators will be able to authorise specific users to use these commands per-channel.*

###### 🛠️ *Features marked with a star are still being brewed in the cauldron (aka work in progress).
